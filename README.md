## Project idea

Our idea is to map Swedish authorities, fundamentally it's a search engine with an admin page. The following pages are planned to be implemented:

- Homepage with menu and search function
- Authority page with advanced filters and search function
    - Subpage for each authority, presenting logo, facts, potentially a map with all their locations.
    - Subpage with a regular list of all authorities
- Department page: Show how all authorities are subordinate to different departments, some kind of graph - node link diagram.

- Admin login homepage
- Authority editing page
- Preview of adding an authority

Authority = Myndighet<br>
Department = Departement (Svenska)<br>

## Tech stack

Programming language: Javascript & Typescript <br>
Framework: Next.js (Typescript)<br>
Autentication backend: nextAuth.js<br>
Database backend: MongoDB <br>

## Data

The data will be collected by ourselfs from "Regerings Kansliet" and "statskontoret". We are aware that the extra work on the data does not affect the project scope.
